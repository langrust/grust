# Automatic Emergency Braking  (AEB)

The Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) computes the braking strategy required to avoid a sudden
collision with a pedestrian.

## Crate organization

- `data/`: contains the input sequence used in the example of the manuscript, and the expected output sequence
- `out/`: contains a dump of the code generated by the GRust compiler
- `src/`: contains the GRust model and the runner implementation

## Run

Running this example is simply done using `cargo` **at the root of the `grust` workspace**:

```bash
> cargo run --package aeb
```
