# Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)

The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a common feature in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
When active, the ACC system computes the braking force required to maintain a safe distance from a 
preceding vehicle, based on the current speed and the measured distance.

## Crate organization

- `data/`: contains the input sequence used in the example of the manuscript, and the expected output sequence
- `out/`: contains a dump of the code generated by the GRust compiler
- `src/`: contains the GRust model and the runner implementation

## Run

Running this example is simply done using `cargo` **at the root of the `grust` workspace**:

```bash
> cargo run --package acc
```
